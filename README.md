# HeuristicOntology
https://www.heuristicontology.com/

The Heuristic Ontology provides a formal semantic framework for representing heuristics as directive information content entities â€“structured, named, and computationally actionable constructs.

Unlike informal notions of heuristics as vague or unconscious tendencies, this ontology treats them as clearly defined, actionable specifications that can be named, classified, and linked to behavior within information systems. 

Heuristics are treated not as vague psychological tendencies, but as clearly defined, prescriptive specifications that can be operationalized by intelligent agents to guide decision-making. By aligning with Basic Formal Ontology (BFO 2020) and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO 2.0), this ontology ensures conceptual rigor, interoperability, and formal clarity across domains. It supports the classification, inference, and modeling of cognitive strategies in both human and artificial decision systems.
